## Light Intensity on sleep quality

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to use actigraphy data to determine the effects of light exposure on sleep quality by building a classifier then predictor. The research data being used comes in the form of different color light intensities, motor activity, and sleep measurements taken in discrete intervals of time from an actimetry sensor. Provided by the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), this data was obtained through an observational study of 1,887 participants over the course of a week; measurements were taken every 30 seconds.
